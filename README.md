
OG-USA
=========
OG-USA is an overlapping-generations (OG) model of the economy of the United States (USA) that allows for dynamic general equilibrium analysis of federal tax policy. The model outputs focus on the change in macroeconomics aggregates (GDP, investment, consumption), wages, interest rates, and the stream of tax revenues changes over time. Careful documentation of the model, its output, and solution method is available in this repository at [https://github.com/rickecon/OG-USA/blob/doc/documentation/OGUSAdoc.pdf](https://github.com/rickecon/OG-USA/blob/doc/documentation/OGUSAdoc.pdf) and is regularly updated.

Disclaimer
==========
The model is currently under development. Users should be forewarned that the
model components could change significantly. Therefore, there is NO GUARANTEE
OF ACCURACY. THE CODE SHOULD NOT CURRENTLY BE USED FOR PUBLICATIONS, JOURNAL
ARTICLES, OR RESEARCH PURPOSES. Essentially, you should assume the calculations
are unreliable until we finish the code re-architecture and have checked the
results against other existing implementations of the tax code. The package
will have released versions, which will be checked against existing code prior
to release. Stay tuned for an upcoming release!
